# Kidney Disease Outcome

## Description

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using a clinical dataset. The goal is to assist in early detection of CKD by analyzing relevant patient biomarkers and visualizing key insights through an interactive Plotly/Dash dashboard. The project includes preprocessing, training a model, evaluating performance, and highlighting feature importance.

## üß™ Methodology

- Dataset: The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains clinical measurements for 2,300+ patients across features like blood pressure, BUN, creatinine, etc.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and outliers
  - Encoded categorical features
  - Normalized numerical columns

- **Modeling**:
    - Trained a logistic regression classifier
    - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
    - Assessed feature importance to understand key drivers of prediction

## Results

## üìä Model Performance

To evaluate the classification models used for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), we compared **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** using five key performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: When the model predicts CKD, how often is it correct?
- **Recall**: How well does the model identify actual CKD cases?
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced classes.
- **Jaccard Score**: Measures similarity between predicted and actual labels.

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Jaccard |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.6247   | 0.6348    | 0.6213 | 0.6280   | 0.4577  |
| Decision Tree       | 0.6616   | 0.6710    | 0.6596 | 0.6652   | 0.4984  |
| Random Forest       | 0.7072   | 0.7841    | 0.5872 | 0.6715   | 0.5055  |

### üîç Insights

- **Random Forest** achieved the highest overall performance in accuracy and F1 score, indicating a strong balance between precision and recall.
- **Decision Tree** showed decent performance but slightly lagged behind Random Forest.
- **Logistic Regression** had the lowest scores across most metrics, making it the least effective model in this comparison.


### Feature Importance

The dashboard highlights the most influential features contributing to the model's prediction. This allows users and clinicians to better understand what clinical indicators matter most.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for health diagnostics. By combining statistical insights with interactive visualizations, it offers a powerful tool for analyzing kidney disease outcomes. Future improvements could include using ensemble models or deploying the app with live patient data integration.
